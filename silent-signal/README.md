# Silent Signal

Silent Signal is a small web app that helps people share how they feel without having to explain everything in words. Instead of long messages, users can create a visual “signal” that represents their emotional state and gives others a gentle idea of how to respond.

## Inspiration
A lot of the time, it’s hard to put emotions into words — especially in places like school or work, where saying how you feel can feel awkward or overwhelming. Silent Signal came from the idea that sometimes people just want to be understood without having to talk too much or justify their emotions.

## What it does
With Silent Signal, users can:
- Pick up to four moods that match how they’re feeling
- Choose a context like School, Work, or Personal
- Set the intensity of those emotions
- Generate an abstract visual card based on their selections
- See a short, empathy-focused suggestion for how others can respond
- Share the signal using a link or download it as an image

## How it was built
This project was built using:
- React with Vite
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Client-side visual generation
- URL-based state sharing for easy sharing

There’s no backend — everything runs directly in the browser.

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges was finding a balance between visuals and meaning. The visuals needed to feel expressive without being confusing, and the interface had to stay simple while still feeling intentional and thoughtful.

## What I learned
- Emotions don’t always need words to be communicated
- Visual design plays a huge role in how people interpret meaning
- Small, focused ideas can still have emotional impact

## What’s next
Some ideas for future improvements:
- Better accessibility options
- Saving and revisiting past signals
- Improving the mobile experience
- More personalized emotional insights

## Demo
A live demo and screenshots are included in the hackathon submission.

Built for a hackathon with care and intention.
